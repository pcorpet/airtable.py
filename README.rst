Airtable.py: Python API wrapper for Airtable
============================================

Python interface to the Airtable's REST API - https://airtable.com -
|Build Status|

For javascript enthusiasts: https://github.com/Airtable/airtable.js

Installation
------------

Airtable Python uses `Requests.py <http://docs.python-requests.org/>`__:
make sure you have it installed by running

::

    $ pip install requests

Getting started
---------------

Once you have created `a new
base <https://support.airtable.com/hc/en-us/articles/202576419-Introduction-to-Airtable-bases>`__
and a new table through the Web interface, you're ready to start using
Airtable Python.

.. code:: python

    from airtable import airtable
    at = airtable.Airtable('BASE_ID', 'API_KEY')
    at.get('TABLE_NAME')

Here's an example of response from the Restaurant's example base

.. code:: python

    {u'records': [
      {u'fields': {u'Diet': u'Kosher or Halal',
        u'Friendly Restaurants': [u'recr0ITqq9C1I92FL', u'recGeAJLw0ZkbwdXZ'],
        u'Icon': [{u'filename': u'no-pig.jpg',
          u'id': u'attzKGOBbjndOx0FU',
          u'size': 34006,
          u'thumbnails': {u'large': {u'height': 202,
            u'url': u'https://dl.airtable.com/trmtq3BaRoa0sWnyffWZ_large_no-pig.jpg',
            u'width': 256},
           u'small': {u'height': 36,
            u'url': u'https://dl.airtable.com/yzuRv5CyRs2PVH4fDvCe_small_no-pig.jpg',
            u'width': 46}},
          u'type': u'image/jpeg',
          u'url': u'https://dl.airtable.com/DyGOjAASze6AIkQxFpDv_no-pig.jpg'}],
        u'People': [u'Annie', u'Maryam']},
       u'id': u'rec5sD6mBBd0SaXof'},
       ...

API Reference
-------------

The available methods closely mimick the `REST
API <https://airtable.com/api>`__:

Get
~~~

Given a table name, fetched one or multiple records.

.. code:: python

    at.get(table_name, table_name, record_id=None, limit=0, offset=None,
           filter_by_formula=None, view=None, max_records=0, fields=[])

where

::

    table_name (required) is a string representing the table name
    record_id (optional) is a string, which fetches a specific item by id. If not specified, all items are fetched
    limit (optional) is an integer, and it can only be specified if record_id is not present, and limits the number of items fetched (see pageSize in the AirTable documentation)
    offset is a string representing the record id from which we start the offset
    filter_by_formula (optional) is a string to filter the retrieving records (see filterByFormula in the AirTable documentation)
    max_records (optional) is the total number of records that will be returned (see maxRecords in the AirTable documentation)
    fields (optional) is a list of strings with the field names to be returned

Iterate
~~~~~~~

Given a table name, fetched all records.

.. code:: python

    at.iterate(table_name, table_name, limit=0, offset=None,
           filter_by_formula=None, view=None, max_records=0, fields=[])

where

::

    table_name (required) is a string representing the table name
    limit (optional) is an integer, and it can only be specified if record_id is not present, and limits the number of items fetched (see pageSize in the AirTable documentation)
    offset is a string representing the record id from which we start the offset
    filter_by_formula (optional) is a string to filter the retrieving records (see filterByFormula in the AirTable documentation)
    max_records (optional) is the total number of records that will be returned (see maxRecords in the AirTable documentation)
    fields (optional) is a list of strings with the field names to be returned

**Note**: this returns a generator instead, which you can use to loop
each record:

.. code:: python

    # example with similar results of at.get
    result = { "records": [] }
    for r in self.at.iterate(self.table, fields=fields):
        result["records"].append(r)

Create
~~~~~~

Creates a new entry in a table, and returns the newly created entry with
its new ID.

.. code:: python

    at.create(table_name, data)

where

::

    table_name (required) is a string representing the table name
    data (required) is a dictionary containing the fields and the resepective values

Update
~~~~~~

Updates *some* fields in a specific entry in the table. Fields which are
not explicitely included will not get updated

.. code:: python

    at.update(table_name, record_id, data)

where

::

    table_name (required) is a string representing the table name
    record_id (required) is a string representing the item to update
    data (required) is a dictionary containing the fields (and the resepective values) to be updated

Update All
~~~~~~~~~~

Like the previous method, but updates all fields, clearing the ones that
are not included in the request.

.. code:: python

    at.update_all(table_name, record_id, data)

Delete
~~~~~~

Delete a specific record from the table

.. code:: python

    at.delete(table_name, record_id)

where

::

    table_name (required) is a string representing the table name
    record_id (required) is a string representing the item to update

Release
-------

To release, tag the Git repo with a new version number, push that tag to GitHub then Travis CI will
do the rest.
